# California_Housing_Prices

## Work still in progress
* All new updates are made in the second branch "classes_for_pipeline".
* There are still a lot of things missing in this project. Almost all the necessary classes for preprocessing of the data are done, so the final preproc. pipeline can be constructed. Than the modeling part will roll in. All the things are tested and written in my jupyter notebook and after i am ~100% sure that they will work and catch errors i'am adding them here. 
* The main notebook with EDA and the walkthrough of my ideas is not finished, since everything is added and tested in my spare time.
